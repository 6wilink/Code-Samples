SOURCE CONTROL VIA MAKEFILE
---------------------------
by Qige @ 2017.03.10

STEP 1. As a developer, you should submit 3 files every time:
    - FILE-01: .tar.gz/.tar.bz2:     compressed src codes.
    - FILE-02: Makefile:             assign URL to download your src file, and the right checksum;
    - FILE-03: README.txt:           tell others what did you changed;

STEP 2. Where can you get a sample files:
    - start with git
        "mkdir git; cd git; git clone https://github.com/zhaoqige/6w-snippets.git; cd 6w-snippets".
    - "./openwrt/pkg-tar-gz/tar-gz/$(PKG_NAME)_$(PKG_VERSION)-$(PKG_RELEASE)/" is a sample of FILE-01 before compressed;
    - "./openwrt/pkg-tar-gz/openwrt-package/Makefile", FILE-02;
    - write "README.txt", FILE-03.

STEP 3. How to start:
    - download sample files (Follow STEP 2);
    - organize your src code structure;
    - compress your src code, get FILE-01;
    - change these items in Makefile, get FILE-02:
        - "PKG_NAME", "PKG_VERSION", "PKG_RELEASE";
        - "PKG_SOURCE_URL", "PKG_MD5SUM".
    - write "README.txt", FILE-03;
    - upload these 3 files to right place;
    - save these files to yourself own repository as backup.

STEP 4. How to know if my src code updated?
    - Update FILE-02 in your own cross-compile dir;
    - exec "make package/*/compile V=s";
    - exec "md5sum dl/*.ipk", see if checksum value is the same as your Makefile.
