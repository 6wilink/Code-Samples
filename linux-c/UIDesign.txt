Things Matters
- UI & UI Design;
- Security & Ownership;
- Hardware Monitor & Control;


Application & Interfaces
------------------------
By last 8 months experience, I strongly suggest us use thes Combo:
- C: 		Hardware Control, Libraries, Interfaces, Command line;
- Shell: 	Pack app into service;
- Lua: 		Data collector & Executor.


UI & UI Design
--------------
Current, we have WebUI; 
but what functions that we really want to put into this?
- Analog Baseband (ABB);
- Hardware Monitor;
- Hardware Control;
- Channel Scan Result;

And UI Design:
- use W3.css as CSS framework;
- use jQuery as JS framework.


Security & Ownership
--------------------
The boxes may be need to identified at these cases:
- Right After Assembled: DEBUG MODE;
- After shipping to clients: First-time use;
- When installed on site: Monitor & Configure;
- When calling customer service: Identify SN/Model;
- When return from clients: Re-cycle.

CASE I:
We need an extension to let our R&D team to login without limitations;
And this part can enable/disable with our own methods.

CASE II:
Normally, we should save/stick a PASSCODE, this code maybe based on WMAC or something like that;
So when first-time use, if user has it in hand, he/she will be able to enter FAIL-SAFE.

CASE III:
As we discussed last week, we should devide this into "ABB & "RADIO" parts.
And "SYSTEM", "NETWORK" parts as well.

CASE IV: 
We should use an Chart to display the scan results.
